I want my homepage to have a list of something that has gone from 2000 to 2020 that has changed. It will have a list of 5 things that have been relevant in that era. For example, There would be a list of 5 songs that have been most popular in the years 2000-2020. Or another idea would be 5 popular video games that were popular for each of these years.
